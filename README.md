# dike_thermal_inversion

Scripts associated with forward and inverse modeling of thermal conduction in 1d around a planar dike. 

Inversion uses the MCMCHammer markov chain monte carlo code of Kyle Anderson: https://gitlab.com/kander/mcmc_hammer

Forward model is standalone matlab code, finite differences on non-uniform grid with multicomponent (dike+host rock) conduction and melting.

Datasets that have been inverted with this model: (U-Th)/He partial resetting in Ap and Zr, Bt/Ar partial resetting, magnetic resetting, Ap fission track
